# Processing-GPUInstance
GPUInstance experiment using processing.org

This repository presents various examples of GPU instancing inside processing.org. 
This is based on OpenGL tutorial : https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Instancing

These are simple implementations and the shapes does not support texture for the moment. Any contribution are welcome if you want to make a better VBO or add some attributes.
Everything has been tested on Windows with an NVidia gtx 1070 GPU
